Miscellaneous data objects:

ge_object is a trivial object that takes various types of coordinates
from my coordinate library and outputs rudimentary google earth KML
placemarks. This makes it easier to assemble KML documents from
coordinates or vectors of coordinates. There's plenty of room for
refinmenent there. Maybe I'll take a crack at adding an XML builder to
cppxml and building the KML with that, rather than just dumping text
tags to a string buffer. If I returned an xml_node for the ge_object,
I could manipulate and assemble them however I wanted before outputting
a final document. Hmm :-D

sp3_factory is an sp3 format ephemeris file reader. These files contain
times and points where a satellite is at that specific time. The SP3
factory reads them and notifies listeners when new points are available.
